# Linux Only
## Installation
Installing qemu first is recommended. My installer just uses apt which is only for debian-based distros.
Configure your setup in config.sh.
Then...
Run run.sh to run the OS, TempleOS. You will have to press 1 on the boot screen to open disk C. The game will then autostart.
When the game ends, it will input the command to the terminal, so you just need to press enter to play again.
To exit Qemu (the virtual machine), use ctrl+alt+g to get control of your cursor, then click machine in the top left, and then quit.
If anything goes wrong, just restart the whole thing, it's pretty quick. :)
